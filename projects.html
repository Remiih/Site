            This C# console application provides a simple yet effective
            inventory management system. Users can add new products, specifying
            their name, price, and initial quantity. The system allows for easy
            tracking of product stock levels, enabling users to sell products
            (reducing quantity) and restock them (increasing quantity). A
            product's price can be updated as needed. The application displays
            the current inventory, clearly indicating which products are sold
            out. The display functionality includes pagination for easy
            navigation through large inventories. Finally, users can delete
            products from the inventory. The application includes robust input
            validation to prevent errors.

            This C# console application is a library management system designed
            to track books and their availability. Users can add new books to
            the library's catalog and remove books that are no longer available.
            The system allows users to search for books to check their
            availability. It supports the core library functions of borrowing
            and checking in books, with a limit of three books borrowed per user
            at a time. The application provides clear output to the user,
            displaying the available books and the user's current borrowed
            books.
