          <p>This C# console application provides a simple yet effective inventory management system. Users can add new products, specifying their name, price, and initial quantity. The system allows for easy tracking of product stock levels, enabling users to sell products (reducing quantity) and restock them (increasing quantity). A product's price can be updated as needed. The application displays the current inventory, clearly indicating which products are sold out. The display functionality includes pagination for easy navigation through large inventories. Finally, users can delete products from the inventory. The application includes robust input validation to prevent errors.</p>

          <p>This C# console application is a library management system designed to track books and their availability.

It supports the core library functions of borrowing and checking in books, with a limit of three books borrowed per user at a time. The application provides clear output to the user, displaying the available books and the user's current borrowed books.</p>
